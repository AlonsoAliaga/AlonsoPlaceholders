# Only PLACEHOLDER and PLACEHOLDER_STATIC type support REGEX expressions. That WON't CHANGE, don't insist.
# Make sure you read EVERYTHING before configuring the plugin and create your placeholders.
# Remember that this is read when placeholder is requested. Don't MAKE THIS too heavy or it could affect server performance.
# When using regex, you can test your expressions in a site like https://alonsoaliaga.com/test-regex
# To use regex YOU MUST HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT. If you don't know how to use it, make some research and learn from videos/sites.
# I'M A DEVELOPER. I cannot help you with Regex as it takes too much time for testing.
# If you know how to use it, do it, if not, learn about it or ask someone to do it for you.
# For PERMISSION and PERMISSION_STATIC type you MUST use commas instead of periods for permissions, they will be replaced internally with periods.
Placeholders:
  #You can create as many placeholders as you want.
  #These identifier names are used internally. They must be unique in this config file.
  #Recommended to use names in lowercase and only include letters, numbers and dashes.
  permission-placeholder-example:
    #This is the parameter that will be added to the main placeholder (which cannot be changed)
    #everything specified here will be added like "alonsoplaceholders_YOUR_INPUT_HERE"
    #In this example placeholder is "player_prefix" which means placeholder to use will be %alonsoplaceholders_player_prefix%
    #This MUST BE UNIQUE and cannot be certain worlds as "developer" or "version"
    Placeholder: "player_prefix"
    #Available types are:
    # STATIC - Only plain text with colors. Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI will not be replaced.
    # NORMAL - Plain text with placeholders from PlaceholderAPI replaced.
    # PERMISSION_STATIC - Returns value based on permission. Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI will NOT be replaced.
    # PERMISSION - Returns value based on permission. Replace Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.
    # PLACEHOLDER_STATIC - Returns value based on placeholder output after parsed. Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI will not be replaced.
    # UNIQUE_PLACEHOLDER - Returns value based on placeholder output after parsed from only one placeholder. Replaces Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI. (This is faster than PLACEHOLDER)
    # UNIQUE_PLACEHOLDER_STATIC - Returns value based on placeholder output after parsed from only one placeholder. Replaces Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI. Replaces Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI. (This is faster than PLACEHOLDER_STATIC)
